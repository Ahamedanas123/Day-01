1.Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2:

HTTP1.1
It loads resources one after the other,so if one resource cannot be loaded,it blocks all the other resources behind it.

HTTP2:
It is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

2.Difference between Object and Its Internal Representation:

Object:
It is defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 

Internal Representation:
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

var myBike{

myBike.name = 'KTM';

myBike.model = 'RC125';

myBike.year = 2018;

myBike.wheels = 2;

}

After creating myBike object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.
